			<p class="center">Turn your board 45 degrees and setup the pieces starting with your king in your corner as shown below:</p>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="2D View of Edgy Chess Setup" src="images/setup.png"/></p>

			<p class="center">Pawns move diagonally forward <i>one</i> step at a time (<img src="images/move-black-small.png" alt="Move"/>)
			and capture to the side of their path (<img src="images/capture-black-small.png" alt="Capture"/>).<br/>
			Pawns are promoted on the opponents non-pawn fields (<img src="images/promote-white-small.png" alt="Promote"/>).<br/><br/>
			Castling is allowed but there is <i>no en passant</i>.<br/><br/>
			All other rules are like in classic chess.</p>

			<h3>Enjoy!</h3>

			<h1>Overview</h1>

			<p><b>Edgy Chess</b> is a variant of Regular Orthodox Classic Western Chess. It uses the same geometry, same type of
			pieces, same number of pieces, castling, an in general the same rules as classic chess. It differs from classic chess
			in the initial setup of the board as well as the movement and promotion of Pawns. </p>

			<p>This all makes a lot of sense when you see the initial board setup with the corner pointing towards you. The beauty
			of this variant is that it can be played with any classic chess board and pieces available in the world and is easy to
			learn for anyone who knows how to play chess. It's actually easier to learn than classic chess since there's no en
			passant rule. The setup also leads to more aggressive play since opponent pieces are on average a bit closer together.</p>

			<p>It looks like chess but it is a new game. Same, same, but different.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="box">

			<h1>Rules</h1>

			<p><i>Note: Differences to classic chess are shown in italic.</i></p>

			<h2>Setup</h2>

			<p><b>Edgy Chess</b> is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which
			is like the board used in draughts (checkers). No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored
			squares are called "light" or "white", and the darker-colored squares are called "dark" or "black". Sixteen "white" and
			sixteen "black" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. <i>The board is placed so that a dark
			corner square is in front of each player.</i></p>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="2D View of Edgy Chess Setup" src="images/setup.png"/>
			<label>Setup</label></p>

			<p>Each player controls sixteen pieces:</p>

			<p>At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged as shown in the diagram. <i>The king is placed in the corner
			first. Then the queen, a bishop, a knight, and a rook are placed along the left edge. A bishop, a knight, and a rook are
			placed along the right edge. The pawns are placed in front of those pieces (see diagram). The phrases to remember this
			setup, are "king in the corner" and "black in front". The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square
			closest to each player is black.</i></p>

			</div>
			<div class="box">

			<h1>Play of the Game</h1>

			<p>The player controlling the white army is named "White"; the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black".
			White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when
			having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as
			explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control, then players who exceed their time limit
			lose the game.</p>

			<h2>Movement</h2>

			<h3>Basic moves</h3>

			<p>Each chess piece has its own method of movement. Moves are made to vacant squares except when capturing an opponent's
			piece.</p>

			<p>Apart from any movement of the knight and the occasional castling maneuver, pieces cannot jump over each
			other. When a piece is captured (or taken), the attacking piece replaces the enemy piece on its square (<i>en passant
			does not exist in Edgy Chess</i>). The captured piece is thus removed from the game and may not be returned to play for
			the remainder of the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).<p>

			<p>The <span class="piecename">king</span> can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Only
			 once per player, per game, is a king allowed to make a special move known as castling (see below).</p>

			</h4>

			<p>The <span class="piecename">knight</span> moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. In
			other words, the knight moves two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or one square horizontally then two
			squares vertically. Its move is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.</p>

			</h4>

			<p><span class="piecename">Pawns</span> have the most complex rules of movement:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A pawn can move forward <i>diagonally</i> one square, if that square is unoccupied. <i>It's not allowed to move
				pawns two squares from the initial position.</i> A pawn cannot move backwards.</li>
				<li>Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of
				the two adjacent spaces to the <i>space they are on</i> (i.e., the two squares <i>orthogonally</i> in front of them) but
				cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant.</li>
				<li>The pawn is also involved in a special move called promotion (see below).</li>
				<li><i>Note: En passant is not available.</i></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>

			</h4>

			<p>Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king,
			adjacent to it. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;</li>
				<li>There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;</li>
				<li>The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by
				an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);</li>
			</ul>

				<i>En Passant</i>
				<img class="piece" alt="Pawn" src="images/pawn-white.png" width="34" height="34"/>
			</h4>

			<i>En passant is not available in Edgy Chess.</i>

				Pawn Promotion
				<img class="piece" alt="Pawn" src="images/pawn-black.png" width="34" height="34"/>
			</h4>

			<p>If a pawn advances to a <i>promotion field (see diagram)</i>, it is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook,
			bishop, or knight of the same color, the choice being at the discretion of its player (a queen is usually chosen). The
			choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine
			queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not
			available, the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece.</p>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="Pawn" src="images/pawn-promo.png"/>
			<label>Pawn promotion</label></p>

			<p>White pawns promote on squares e8-h8-h4 (marked with white diamonds); black pawns on a5-a1-d1 (marked with black
			diamonds). Note that the pawns that start on a6 and h3 cannot promote without moving toward the center of the board via
			capturing.</p>

			<h2>Check</h2>

			<p>A king is in check when it is under attack by one or more enemy pieces. A piece unable to move because it would place
			its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.</p>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="Check" src="images/check.png"/>
			<label>Black's king is in check. It can get out of check by moving to an unattacked square. Black can also parry
			the check by moving the bishop to e5 or the knight to f4 to block the check, or by capturing the white bishop with the knight.</label></p>

			<p>A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Move the king to a square where it is not threatened.</li>
				<li>Capture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).</li>
				<li>Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece.</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<div class="box">

			<h1>End of the Game</h1>

			<h2>Checkmate</h2>

			<p>If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king
			is said to be checkmated, the game ends, and that player loses. Unlike other pieces, the king is never actually captured
			or removed from the board because checkmate ends the game.</p>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="Checkmate" src="images/checkmate.png"/>
			<label>White is checkmated; Black wins</label></p>

			<p>The diagram shows a typical checkmate position. The white king is threatened by the black queen; every square to
			which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be threatened by the
			rook.</p>

			<h2>Draws</h2>

			<p>The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The game is automatically a draw if the player to move is not in check but has no legal move. This situation is
				called a stalemate. An example of such a position is shown in the diagram to the right.</li>
				<li>The game is immediately drawn when there is no possibility of checkmate for either side with any series of legal
				moves. This draw is often due to insufficient material, including the endgames
				<ul>
					<li>king against king;</li>
					<li>king against king and bishop;</li>
					<li>king against king and knight;</li>
					<li>king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on diagonals of the same color.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="center"><img class="board2d" alt="Draw" src="images/draw.png"/>
			<label>Black to move is in stalemate, since his king has no legal move, and is not in check. The game is drawn.</label></p>

			<p>The player having the move may claim a draw by declaring that one of the following conditions exists, or by declaring
			an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fifty-move rule: There has been no capture or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player.</li>
				<li>Threefold repetition: The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces
				having the same rights to move, including the right to castle or capture en passant.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If the claim is proven true, the game is drawn.</p>

			<p>At one time, if a player was able to check the opposing king continually (perpetual check) and the player indicated
			their intention to do so, the game was drawn. This rule is no longer in effect; however, players will usually agree to a
			draw in such a situation, since either the rule on threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule will eventually be
			applicable.</p>

			<h1>Notation</h1>

			<p>Since <b>Edgy Chess</b> is using the same board, pieces, and movements as classic chess, all types of
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation" target="_blank">Chess Notation</a> may be used.</p>

			<p class="center"><img class="classicboard2d" alt="Edgy Chess Setup" src="images/notation-init.png"/>
			<label>Alternative graphic for Edgy Chess setup</label></p>

			<p>On this website, we use the player view for showing Edgy Chess boards and pieces. However, as an alternative
			graphical presentation of an Edgy Chess game, one can certainly use the traditional graphics for chess.</p>
