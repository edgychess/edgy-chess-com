Object: Checkmate the opponent's King by attacking it so it cannot escape.

Turn your board 45 degrees and setup the pieces starting with your king in your
corner. Pawns move diagonally forward one step at a time and capture to the 
side of their path. Pawns are promoted on the opponents non-pawn fields.
Castling is allowed but there is no en passant. All other rules are like in
